Foto-Finder was assigned as the final project in Turing Module-1 to show the knowledge gained in the first 6 weeks at Turing.

I was asked to recreate a UI layout as well as implement some functionality including the ability to add, delete, and edit photos. A user is hypothetically able to add a photo to a list of favorites, display photos by favorite and by most recently created. A user would also be able to search the titles and captions of the photos using a search bar. The search results would update as a user typed.
